🖥️ Operating Systems Lab – Sheet 3
ENCS351 – Simulation of Scheduling, File Allocation & Memory Management
📌 Overview

This repository contains the complete solution for Operating Systems Lab Sheet 3, implemented in Python.
The lab covers essential OS concepts including CPU scheduling, memory allocation strategies, and file allocation techniques.
Each task includes Python code and explanations.

🧪 Tasks Included
✅ Task 1 – CPU Scheduling Algorithms

Priority Scheduling

Round Robin Scheduling

Calculates:

Waiting Time (WT)

Turnaround Time (TAT)

Generates a Gantt Chart–style sequence

✅ Task 2 – Sequential File Allocation

Simulates sequential allocation of files in continuous memory blocks.
Validates:

Start block

Length

Availability of blocks

✅ Task 3 – Indexed File Allocation

Implements index-block based allocation that maps:

Index block → data blocks
Ensures:

No block is assigned twice

All inputs are valid

✅ Task 4 – Contiguous Memory Allocation

Simulates:

First Fit

Best Fit

Worst Fit
Shows memory assignment for each process and leftover space in partitions.

✅ Task 5 – MFT & MVT Memory Management

Includes:

MFT (Fixed Partitioning)

MVT (Variable Partitioning)
Displays internal & external fragmentation behavior.
